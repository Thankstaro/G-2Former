# G^2Former
The official implementation for NeurIPS 2025 paper "Restricted Global-Aware Graph Filters Bridging GNNs and Transformer for Node Classification".

## Requirements
Tested with Python 3.10, PyTorch 2.4.0, and PyTorch Geometric 2.6.1, dgl 2.4.0+cu124.

## Dataset
The required datasets and their splits can be referred to in [tunedGNN](https://github.com/LUOyk1999/tunedGNN). Some datasets (e.g., OGB) will be automatically downloaded when running the code.

## Run the codes

Please refer to the bash script [run.sh](https://github.com/Thankstaro/G-2Former/blob/main/run.sh) in each folder for running the training and evaluation pipeline.
